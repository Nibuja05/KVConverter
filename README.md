# KVConverter
Simple python programm, to convert dota2's abilities.
It is currently in work, so bugs and missing functionality has to be expected.

## What it does
This is a programm that can convert any datadriven ability from one of your addon folders to a lua ability. Additionaly Modifiers will get converted to lua modifiers and any lua code, that was previously executed with "RunScript" will be be used in the new lua ability, only with some minor adjustments that have to be made.

## Usage
To use it run KV_Converter_Main.py or the equivilent KV_Converter_Main.exe in the dist folder. Type -h for more help or input it directly as parameter. All parameters can be directly used with the execution of the .py or .exe file.
